/* Problem Statement

A college offers a course that prepares students for the state
licensing exam for real-estate brokers. Last year, ten of the
students who completed this course took the exam. You've been
asked to write a program to summarize the results. You've been
given a list of the 10 students. Next to each name is written
a 1 if the student passed the exam or a 2 if the student failed.

Your program should analyze the results of the exam as follows:

1. Input each test result (i.e. a 1 or a 2). Display the message
"Enter result" on the screen each time the program requests 
another test result.

2. Count the number of test result of each type.

3. Display a summery of the test results, indicating the number
of students who passed and the number who failed.

4. If more than eight students passed the exam, print "Bonus to
instructor!"

*** Let's begin the top-down, stepwise refinement ***

Initialize variables
Input the 10 exam results, and count passes and failures
Print summary of the exam results and decide whether a bonus should
be paid.
